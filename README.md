## Installation

Clone the repo, run `npm install` to install dependencies, then run `npm run build` to build the application.

## Usage

Run `npm run start` to run the application. By default, the app will run on localhost3001 (can be edited in the server/server.js file to another port.) Once open in a broswer there is an option to install the application to your machine and run it outside of the browser.
